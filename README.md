# NeuralNetwork_Basics

Steps to build Neural Network with Keras and TensorFlow libraries

1> Installing and importing the TensorFlow and Keras libraries

2> Importing the other required libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

3> Importing the dataset

4> Encoding categorical independent variables

5> Splitting the dataset into test and train

6> Feature Scaling (Optional)

7> Initialising the Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

8> Adding the input, hidden and output layers

9> Compiling the ANN

10> Fitting the ANN to the training set

11> Predicting the test set results

12> Making confusion matrix (Optional)
